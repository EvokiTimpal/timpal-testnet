# TIMPAL Testnet

**A fully decentralized blockchain. No servers. No governance. Code is law.**

```
Symbol:     TMPL
Max Supply: 250,000,000 TMPL
Block Time: 3 seconds
Consensus:  VRF-Based Validator Selection
```

## What is TIMPAL?

TIMPAL is a decentralized blockchain with equal rewards for all participants. Like Bitcoin, there is no central authority, no governance committee, and no way to change the rules without consensus.

**Core Principles:**
- Every active node shares block rewards equally
- One node per device (enforced)
- Fixed emission schedule (37.5 years)
- Immutable rules - no governance votes

## 🚀 Bitcoin-Style Decentralized Launch

**This blockchain launches like Bitcoin in 2009:**
- No pre-mine, no ICO, no company
- Code released on GitHub
- Anyone can download and run it
- Network forms organically peer-to-peer
- No central coordinator or authority

### Quick Start (Run a Node in 5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository

- Earn testnet TMPL (no real value, testing only)

**How to Join:**

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/EvokiTimpal/timpal-testnet.git
cd timpal-testnet
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Create wallet
python3 wallet_cli.py

# 3. Start your node (join the testnet)
python3 run_testnet_node.py --port 3000 --seed wss://timpaltestnet.replit.app
```

**Full Instructions:** See **[JOIN_TESTNET.md](JOIN_TESTNET.md)** for complete step-by-step guide.

### 🧭 Running the TIMPAL Block Explorer

The TIMPAL Block Explorer provides a web interface to view blockchain data, transactions, validators, and network statistics.

#### **Understanding Ports: Node vs Explorer**

When you run a blockchain node, it uses **TWO ports**:

| Component | Port | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **P2P Network** | Your `--port` value (e.g., 8001) | Node-to-node blockchain communication |
| **HTTP API** | Your port + 1 (e.g., 8002) | Explorer connects here for data |

**Example:**
```bash
# Node on port 3000 creates:
# - P2P Network: port 3000 (talks to other nodes)
# - HTTP API: port 3001 (explorer uses this)
python run_testnet_node.py --port 3000 --seed wss://timpaltestnet.replit.app
```

#### **Starting the Explorer**

**If your node is on port 9000 (bootstrap node):**
```bash
# HTTP API is on 9001 (default)
python3 start_explorer.py --port 8080
```

**If your node is on a different port (e.g., 8001):**
```bash
# Tell explorer to use HTTP API on port 8002 (8001 + 1)
export EXPLORER_API_PORT=8002
python3 start_explorer.py --port 8080
```

**Quick Reference Table:**

| Your Node Port | HTTP API Port | Explorer Command |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| 9000 | 9001 (default) | `python3 start_explorer.py --port 8080` |
| 8001 | 8002 | `EXPLORER_API_PORT=8002 python3 start_explorer.py --port 8080` |
| 9005 | 9006 | `EXPLORER_API_PORT=9006 python3 start_explorer.py --port 8080` |

**The explorer will start and show:**
```
Starting TIMPAL Block Explorer on port <port>...
Explorer URL: http://0.0.0.0:<port>
```

**Troubleshooting:** If transfers fail with "Cannot connect to host" or "Failed to fetch account info", ensure your node is running and the HTTP API port is accessible.

**Access in your browser:**
- `http://localhost:<port>`
- `http://0.0.0.0:<port>`
- `http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:<port>`

**Security Note:**
- CORS settings currently allow API requests only from `http://localhost:5000`
- This does NOT prevent you from viewing the explorer UI on any port
- The web interface works on all ports; only API cross-origin requests are restricted

**Troubleshooting:**
- If port 5000 is busy (macOS ControlCenter uses it), simply start the explorer on a different port:
  ```bash
  python3 app/explorer.py --port 6000
  ```

## Tokenomics

**Smallest Unit: Pals**
- 1 TMPL = 100,000,000 pals
- Like Bitcoin's satoshis

**Phase 1: Emission (37.5 years)**
- Block reward: 0.6345 TMPL + transaction fees
- Total emission: 250,000,000 TMPL
- **Distribution: Equal split among ALL active validators**
- No advantage for block proposer, early joiners, or coordinator

**Phase 2: Fee-Only (After 37.5 years)**
- Block reward: Transaction fees only
- Deflationary economics
- Self-sustaining network

### Equal Reward Distribution Formula

```python
per_validator_reward = (block_reward + transaction_fees) / validator_count
```

**Example with 10 validators (block has 2 transactions):**
- Block reward: 0.6345 TMPL
- Transaction fees: 0.001 TMPL (2 × 0.0005 fixed fee)
- Per validator: (0.6345 + 0.001) / 10 = **0.06355 TMPL**
- **All 10 validators earn exactly the same!**

**Note:** Transaction fee is fixed at 0.0005 TMPL. Sender pays amount + fee, recipient gets exact amount.

**True egalitarian economics - everyone earns equally!**

## Block Explorer Endpoints

The local explorer provides read-only access to blockchain data:

```
GET /                   - Homepage with stats
GET /blocks             - List recent blocks
GET /blocks/{height}    - Specific block details
GET /tx/{hash}          - Transaction lookup
GET /address/{address}  - Address balance and history
GET /validators         - Genesis validator set
GET /stats              - Network statistics
GET /search/{query}     - Universal search
```

## Security

**Cryptography:**
- ECDSA signatures (secp256k1)
- SHA-256 hashing
- AES-256-GCM wallet encryption
- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 key derivation (210,000 iterations)

**Wallet Protection:**
- 12-word BIP39-style recovery phrase
- Minimum 6-digit PIN requirement
- Encrypted storage

**Device Enforcement (One Node Per Device):**
- Hardware-based device fingerprinting prevents reward gaming
- Exclusive lock mechanism blocks multiple nodes on same device
- Persistent device ID based on machine-id/platform-uuid/MAC address
- Critical for maintaining fairness in reward distribution
- Attempts to run multiple nodes will fail with clear error message

## Immutability & Updates

**CRITICAL: This blockchain is 100% immutable after launch.**

- **No governance mechanism** - The code cannot be changed by votes or committees
- **No update mechanism** - Once launched, the rules are permanent
- **No central authority** - No one can modify the protocol

**What this means for node operators:**
- If you want different rules, you must fork the entire codebase
- Security patches require community consensus and manual re-downloads
- Feature requests cannot be implemented without a new chain
- This is by design - immutability ensures fairness and predictability

**Like Bitcoin:** The protocol is set in stone. Changes require overwhelming community consensus and a completely new distribution.

**Network Security:**
- Signature verification on all blocks
- Fixed genesis validators
- Merkle root validation
- Emission cap enforcement

## Security Audit Report

**Date:** October 27, 2025

✅ Zero vulnerabilities or logic flaws  
✅ Emission enforcement verified  
✅ Consensus integrity verified  
✅ Immutable, production-ready release

## Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
pytest app/tests/test_flow.py -v
```

All 15 tests must pass:
- ✅ Wallet PIN functionality
- ✅ Block timing (3 seconds)
- ✅ Balance tracking
- ✅ Reward calculations
- ✅ Max supply enforcement (250M cap)
- ✅ Consensus rotation
- ✅ Transaction signing
- ✅ Mempool operations

## Development

TIMPAL has no central development team. Like Bitcoin:

1. **Code is open source** - Anyone can read and verify
2. **Changes require consensus** - No single authority
3. **Market-driven evolution** - Node operators choose to upgrade
4. **Voluntary participation** - Run any version you trust

## Philosophy

**Decentralization for Everyone**

Unlike Bitcoin (mining pools) or Ethereum (staking validators), TIMPAL ensures every participant has equal power and rewards. One device = one node = equal share.

**Immutability**

The blockchain launched with fixed rules. There is no governance, no voting, and no way to change the protocol without hard fork consensus.

**Sustainability**

After 37.5 years of emission, the network transitions to a fee-only economy. This creates natural deflation and ensures long-term security.
